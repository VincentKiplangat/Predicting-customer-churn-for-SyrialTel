## 1.BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
For telecommunication companies to grow their revenue generating base, it is key to attract new customers and at the same time increase customer retention rate. Syriatel is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. It has established that long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. Churn prediction has therefore become a very important part of the company's strategy. This project aims to develop a model which accurately predicts customers who are most likely to churn, and identify the features that are important for predicting customer churn. Syriatel can thus act to prevent the customer who is likely to churn from actually churning.

## 2.DATA UNDERSTANDING
The Churn in Telecom’s dataset from Kaggle contains information about customer activity and whether or not they canceled their subscription with the Telecom firm. The goal of this dataset is to develop predictive models that can help the telecom business reduce the amount of money lost due to customers who don’t stick around for very long.

The dataset contains 3333 entries and 21 columns, including information about the state, account length, area code, phone number, international plan, voice mail plan, number of voice mail messages, total day minutes, total day calls, total day charge, total evening minutes, total evening calls, total evening charge, total night minutes, total night calls, total night charge, total international minutes, total international calls, total international charge, customer service calls and churn.

In this phase of the project, we will focus on getting familiar with the data and identifying any potential data quality issues. We will also perform some initial exploratory data analysis to discover first insights into the data.
